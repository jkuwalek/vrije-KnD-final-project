# How to run

This project uses [pixi](https://pixi.sh/) to manage decencies.

1. Install [pixi](https://pixi.sh/)
2. Open the src/final_result/final pipeline.ipynb
3. Select the pixi environment as the kernel
4. Run the notebook

# Structure

### data

This folder contains the source files - a blank epi ontology and Covid-19 pandemic data .

### src/final_result

This folder contains files generated by the pipeline, most notably 
- epi_extended.ttl (epi + hdo ontologies)
- epi_explicit.owl (an ontology populated by explicit triples)
- epi_with_inferrences.owl (fully populated knowledge graph including the inferred triples)

In order to run the pellet reasoner a java installation is required. 
To install Java on your machine:
    1. Download Java Development Kit (JDK):
        Go to Oracle's JDK download page or OpenJDK for an open-source version.
        Download the latest version for your operating system.

    2. Install JDK:
        Run the installer you downloaded and follow the instructions.
        During installation, note the installation path (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-<version> on Windows).

    3. Set up the Java Environment Variable (if needed):
        On Windows:
            Go to Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables.
            Under "System variables," click New and set the variable name as JAVA_HOME and the variable value as the path to your JDK (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-<version>).
            Find the "Path" variable, click Edit, and add %JAVA_HOME%\bin to the list.
        On macOS/Linux:
            Open a terminal and edit the .bashrc or .zshrc file.
            Add the line export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk (replace with your JDK path).
            Add export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH to add Java to your PATH.

    4. Verify the Java Installation:
        Open a terminal or command prompt and type: bash java -version
        You should see the Java version if the installation was successful.
        If not, restarting the computer might fix it.
